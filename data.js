            "The Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG ‘Chicago Lost & Found’ brings back the iconic silhouette that started it all. Featuring the high-cut shape of the original 1985 release, the leather upper combines a white base with a black signature Swoosh and scarlet overlays at the forefoot and heel. Cracked black leather appears on the padded collar, while a vintage pre-yellowed finish is applied to the white rubber midsole. The vintage ‘80s aesthetic extends to the special packaging, highlighted by a damaged box plastered with sale stickers and topped with a mismatched replacement lid. An accompanying sales invoice is emblematic of a time when the Air Jordan 1 lingered on the shelves of mom and pop stores, eventually making their way into the hands of lucky customers at a steep discount.",
